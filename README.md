# Earthquakes Captured By USGS Over The Last Week

This project allows the user to observe all recorded tectonic data over the world that has occured over the past week thanks to a live API key that sources accurate data from USGS (United States Geological Survey).
The data is presented as an interactive map and allows the user to shift between three different map views. It also gives them the option to toggle three different overlays. One showing all earthquakes, another showing all major earthquakes, and one that shows the tecnotic plates over the world to make connections between where earthquakes are occuring, and near which tectonic region.
