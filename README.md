# Earthquakes Captured By USGS Over The Last Week

This project allows the user to observe all recorded tectonic data over the world that has occured in the last week thanks to a live API key that sources accurate data from The United States Geological Survey (USGS).

The data is presented as an interactive map and allows the user to shift between three different map views. It also gives them the option to toggle three different overlays. 
* One showing *all* earthquakes.
* Another showing all *major* earthquakes.
* One that shows the *tecnotic plates* over the world.
